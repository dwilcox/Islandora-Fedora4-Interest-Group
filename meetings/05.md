## Notes

* migration-utils
   * Working on [fcrepo4-labs/migration-utils](https://github.com/fcrepo4-labs/migration-utils) with Apache Camel to make [camel based migration-utils](https://github.com/Islandora-labs/migration-utils/tree/camel-service)
   * This solves a future issue of batch ingesting for Islandora. Camel has handy XML processing tools. Also adding an ActiveMQ broker to maintain objects but not in-memory.
   * Trying to re-create relationships in Fedora 4 using old ones from RELS-EXT. Store Fedora 3 to Fedora 4 mapping in SQLite DB.
   * migration-utils to support (in this order):
      * traversing the objectStore filesystem
      * archive export format
      * migrate export format
   * Export format has size limit bug, will that be an issue? Traversing the filesystem uses the objectStore so does not have that issue and will probably be the primary channel of migration. Trying to use alternates (ActiveMQ) to not hold everything in memory as processing.

* Data Modeling
   * Checkout [PDCM](https://wiki.duraspace.org/display/FF/Portland+Common+Data+Model) and get involved in the discussion.
   * Hydra Metadata Working Group - dealing with some of the same issues we will be dealing with in migrating data models.
   * Nick started [draft of large image](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/wiki/Islandora-Labs/islandora/images/Islandora-SP-Large-Image-Fedora4.jpg) data model in new PDCM.
   * Trying to resolve some property conversions. fedora:ownerId -> fedora:createdBy. However this is system-managed and is immutable. May need a second property to transfer the original Fedora 3 owner.
   * Draft data model does not use PCDM relationships in it. 
      * Planned for 2-stage process, migrate content and then deal with the change to PCDM second. Unless we want to do it all now.
   * Question: Do we have to use hasParent for our models? 
      * Not required, it is actually a system assigned property and is downward facing pcdm:hasMember.
   * Question: Isn't downward pointing references lead to more updates and a possible scalability issue? 
      * This does cause more interactions, but is not necessarily a scalability issue. 
      * Some of these relationships are system-managed and created automatically as PCDM is a combination of relationships
   * Should we define a prefix and get an ontology published? 
      * Islandora is part of larger Fedora community, it would be nice to have a common set of predicates across the Fedora community. Send information to fedora-tech list to ask about commonalities that can be shared to avoid duplication of relations. (Nick todo)
   * Change fedora prefixed relations to pcdm relations. fedora:hasContent -> pcdm:hasFile
   * Need to create all PCDM relationships in our data models.
   * [draft datastream property mapping](https://github.com/Islandora-Labs/islandora/blob/7.x-2.x/docs/technical-documentation/migration.md#fcrepo3-datastream-properties-to-fcrepo4)
      * Format URI should have a standardize property to use. 
      * Mapping Fedora 3 properties into Fedora 4 namespace properties can cause problems as they are system-managed and immutable. There are some ways to get around some properties, but not guaranteed.
      * What about *External* and *Redirect* datastreams? 
         * Focus has been on Managed and Inline from Fedora 3, Fedora 4 does not differentiate.
         * Example redirect datastreams or edge-case examples to be shared to https://github.com/Islandora-Labs/upgration-test-fixtures. 
         * Creating an external link in Fedora 4 ```curl -X PUT -H"Content-Type: message/external-body; access-type=URL; URL=\"http://www.example.com/file\"" "http://localhost:8080/rest/node/to/create"```
   * Side-effects of migration
      * No need for *islandora:root* object
      * In general not going to have default solution pack *content model* objects, can be a RDF property label.
      * Some people are using these to create inherited properties in new content-models. Perhaps set as an optional on install.
      * Discussion...
         * Does that assume there are no other objects in the repository that use the islandora:root.
         * Can islandora:root be a reference to a remote object?
         * Content-models act as useful examples of the content type.
         * Overloading the content models by creating inter-relationships between content models.
         * What about Collection Policy? Only DS-Composite(??) to restrict mime-types.
      * Mark will add this to [Islandora migration issue queue](https://github.com/Islandora-Labs/islandora/issues) to discuss.
      * Currently no way to do Content-Model validation at the Fedora layer. Stefano Cossu (Chicago Art Institute) has a use-case but no plans in place to add to Fedora.
      * What about a centrally managed ontology and content-models, instead of handling them in each repository.
   * Add unique content-types to [Upgration Test Fixture](https://github.com/Islandora-Labs/upgration-test-fixtures) repo.
   * Once default Islandora content is modelled, then worry about unique content.
* Audit Service
   * Hydra/Fedora/Islandora/etc designed a plan for an [Audit Service](https://wiki.duraspace.org/display/FF/Design+-+Audit+Service). Sprint to start on March 30th. Esme Cowles to lead the sprint.
   * Danny : Triplestore was optional, but is now required for the Audit Service. So we need a [good triplestore](https://github.com/Islandora-Labs/islandora/issues/30).
* Issue / Technical updates
   * Danny has some changes, to come soon.
* Documentation - Not much
* Install/devops - Not much
* Use cases - Add them! 

Next meeting Friday April 24, 2015 @ 1pm Eastern.
