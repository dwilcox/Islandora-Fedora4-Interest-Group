## Agenda

1. Introductions - recorded in the Attendance
   
2. [migration-utils](https://github.com/fcrepo4-labs/migration-utils)
    * [Portland Common Data Model](https://wiki.duraspace.org/display/FF/Portland+Common+Data+Model) ([repo](https://github.com/duraspace/pcdm))
      * Mike and Danny have been doing alot of work on this recently. A recent ticket took care of legacy systems and FOXML. 
      * There is a [new table](https://github.com/fcrepo4-labs/migration-utils#property-mappings) with mappings. Some decisions have been made about how to map Fedora 3 properties that don't exist in Fedora4 (details in the table) 
      * Undeclared namespaces will show up as ns001, ns002, etc. [This](https://jira.duraspace.org/browse/FCREPO-1553?jql=labels%20%3D%20fedora-3-to-4-migration) allows users to register useful namespace prefixes.
      * Andrew: are we encouraging folks to test these mappings or waiting until more mapping is done?
       * Nick: We are definitely encouraging people to test. If you are using the Islandora 7.x-2.x vagrant machine and install migration utils on it you can configure it to do some testing.
     * Andrew: If you want to run migration utils, there's a [PR going in today](https://github.com/fcrepo4-labs/migration-utils/pull/19) that will have it packaged as an executable .jar file. 
    * [Hydra Metadata Working Group](https://wiki.duraspace.org/display/hydra/Hydra+Metadata+Working+Group)
        * Next steps: Working with Hydra and greater Fedora community on PCDM. Concentrate on mappings and modelling. Help is welcome! Please contact Nick. And get involved in the [Hydra Metadata Working Groups](https://wiki.duraspace.org/display/hydra/Hydra+Metadata+Working+Group) (it's just a name. All are welcome).
        * [Islandora Metadata Interest Group](https://github.com/Islandora/Islandora-Metadata-Interest-Group) is not quite related, but may touch on this is asked.
    * [migration modeling](https://github.com/Islandora-Labs/islandora/blob/7.x-2.x/docs/technical-documentation/migration.md)
    * [Islandora Ontology](https://github.com/Islandora-Labs/islandora_ontology)
      * Nick built up Islandora Ontology, mapping how things currently stand with Islandora 7.x and Fedora 3. There is one for [RELS-EXT](https://github.com/Islandora-Labs/islandora_ontology/blob/master/relsext.rdf) and [RELS-INT](https://github.com/Islandora-Labs/islandora_ontology/blob/master/relsint.rdf). Some are Solution Pack specific (Paged Content, Compound, Image Annotation), some are from XACML. We can use this to start the discussion on how these should carry over to Fedora 4 - leave them as legacy, map them, etc?
      * Robin: Should we record in the comments what SP each of these is used by? Where would be the best place to record why the field exists at all?
        * Nick: All of those things would be good in the RDFS comments
      * Robin: Should we documents things used by single SP's seperately? Image Annotation brings a lot of odd things to the table
        * Conclusion: As long as we're just documenting modules in the release, it's ok. We can ask community members to follow this template for documenting their own unique predicates. [Example from Islandora 7.x-2.x](https://github.com/Islandora-Labs/islandora/blob/7.x-2.x/docs/technical-documentation/islandora-namespace-predicates.md) and how it's been done so far.
        * Definitely should start adding comments for where these come from. Will ask on the list for opinions about how this should be included.
3. Drupal integration... GO DANNY! GO!
    * New features!
    * 7.x-2.x branch of Islandora Labs has a vagrant environment that will demonstrate all of this:
      * There is now an interface for field <-> RDF mapping for Drupal nodes.
      * Interface for namepsaces and prefixes
      * All from third party module: [RDFX](https://www.drupal.org/project/rdfx)
      * There is a proof of concept where you can create collections using the Drupal "Add Content" button (for the first time, EVER.). There are Islandora specific content types: Collection and Basic Image. Create with Drupal, end up with it in Fedora, with information send back from Fedora to the node (like hasPath and hasPredicate).
      * DC and MODS modules can be enabled to define ready made fields. Attach a MODS doc to a node, define the RDF mapping on that field, create the node and it will extract that MODs into Fedora.
      * You can work in RDF, you can work in XML, you can do a little of both- it all works, with a Drupal UI.
      * For now it only works at creation time, but edit is coming.
      * Once it works for editng and the full sync is working all the time, Danny will move on to Basic Image & others.
      * We are starting to need testers to find the bugs.
      * Mark: What about Solution Packs? How does Camel replace these?
        * Danny: We're not calling them SPs right now, but the content types are there. They will probably stil exist as packages for content types, viewers, etc. The middleware will provide service-per content-type to handle the objects. It will accept Drupal info and hand it over to the services middleware (with the caveat that not everything will live in Drupal, such as the high res OBJ datastream).Solution Pack functionality will get sliced up: Display in Drupal, creation/update in middelware, derivative creation elsewhere. Some may end up in sub-modules, which could then be shared by more than one "solution pack"
        * Drupal stuff may get seperated out into its own Git repo so that we can put it on Drupal.org.
4. [Islandora XML Forms use cases](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1zkyy40v4lz03rpjpmVHWujU9LQcxrsA4EC75D1d7X7A/edit)
    * We will have another meeting just for this, some time in mid to late June (after OR2015) to review, merge, and weight the use cases. Still collecting more in the meantime.
5. [Documentation](http://islandora-labs.github.io/islandora/)
    * Not much is new. Migration utils readme is the canonical mapping place for now. 
6. [Audit Service](https://wiki.duraspace.org/display/FF/Audit+Service+Implementation+Proposal)
7.  * Fedora 4.2 (just released) contains new audit service. Islandora community participation has helped to make sure this will suit our needs. It's half externalized, half stored within the repo. 
7. [Issues](https://github.com/islandora-labs/islandora/issues)
    * Not much new here either.
8. [Install/DevOps](https://github.com/Islandora-Labs/islandora/tree/7.x-2.x/install)
    * New vagrant stuff went up recently.
9. [Use cases](https://github.com/Islandora/Islandora-Fedora4-Interest-Group/labels/use%20case)
